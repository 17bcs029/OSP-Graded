# OSP-Graded

This repository has a research on open source projects and organisations. I wanted a
research on all or at least the large open source organisations but could not find one.
So if you are interested in researching an open source organisation please add a PR.
Currently I will be posting the research done per open source organisation per ticket.
Please feel free in opening a ticket and claim any open source organisation.

Things you might want a research on

- Projects under an open source organisation
- Maintainers per project
- Committers per project
- Documentation In the organisation
- Labels in the projects
- Project published
- Task list
- Regions included in an open source organisation
- Diversity of any other or any form


This should be automated and should be reproducible. I might pitch it even with few
organisations studied, so please claim your work accordingly.
